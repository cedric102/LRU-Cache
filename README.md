# This repo presents the LeetCode solution for "460. LFU Cache"

Currently, there is the Raw and smartptr version available.

The Raw pointer solution is of course faster, but would be at risk of memory leak if used outside the premise of LeetCode.

I will need to do some cleanup in the code and split it in respective files.
